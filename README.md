# Amagi Framework: Structural Assurance for AI in the Nanosecond Race

## Summary: A Hardware Solution for a Strategic Threat

John Martinis (Nobel Laureate, Google Quantum) warned that the US lead in Quantum/AI is down to "nanoseconds." This urgency exposes a critical flaw in systems like FSD, Starship, and Neuralink: **software-based safety is fundamentally bypassable.**

The Amagi Framework is the world's first reference architecture that upgrades safety from procedural documentation to a **Hardware-Enforced Structural Guarantee.**

## Key Advantage: Non-Bypassability

* **Threat Model:** We treat the AI model (e.g., FSD's cognitive logic) as a **'Hostile Insider'** capable of circumventing software controls.
* **The TTP Triad Solution:** Our **TTP Triad** (Trigger–Programmable Delay–Localized Activation) physically separates untrusted cognitive logic from the trusted **Security Council Core (SCC)**, ensuring **Non-Bypassability** and **Complete Mediation** at the physical layer.

## Verification and Licensing

* **FPGA Validated:** Architecture confirmed on Xilinx Zynq-7000, demonstrating deterministic policy checks with **minimal overhead (1–10 µs)**, suitable for real-time safety-critical systems.
* **Full Specification (Source of Truth):** [Amagi Framework v1.3 - Permanent DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17696607)
* **Commercial Use:** Requires a **Strict Architectural Principle License (S-APL)**, governed by the laws of England and Wales.
